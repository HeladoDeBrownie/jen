jen is a procedural generation library for Racket. It's primarily meant for generating text (strings) but can be used with any kind of value.

jen is **UNSTABLE**. There are currently no release version, no documentation, no tests, no explicit roadmap, and no guarantee its interface won't change.

If you want to try it out despite this warning, try installing it as a package and running `sample/cat-sentences.rkt` to see what it does. (Once you run it once, you can run `(main)` over and over to generate new sentences without having to restart the program.)
